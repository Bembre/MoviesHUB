**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Import Database**

If you are using XAMPP server, import the `movie.sql` file into your database as `movie`. This will create the necessary tables for the project.

**Step 2: Copy or Pull the Folder**

Copy or pull the entire folder into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.

**Step 3: Run the Website**

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_folder_name/index.php` to run the website. Replace `your_folder_name` with the actual name of the folder you copied or pulled.

**That's it!**

You should now be able to access the website and start exploring. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue or contact the maintainers.

**Note:** Make sure you have XAMPP server installed and running on your system before following these steps.
